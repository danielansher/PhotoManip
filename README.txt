[Multiple Photos w/ Animation Not Supported]
- All the requirements of the rubric are implemented. However, multiple photos are not supported in the animations. (Tags are incorrectly being set between multiple photos.). There is support for 2+ tags (if 3 or 4 tags are selected). The median of the coordinates are computed for all cases.

[Replicate Proper Functionality]
1- Run the program
2- File -> Import -> Select Photo
3- Select Any Tag(s) (e.g. Vacation, Family, School, Work)
4- View -> Grid View
5- Magnet Mode -> On
6- Add Magnet(s) -> Select corresponding tag(s) from step 3
7- Drag around! Feel free to remove and re-add the magnets as well. 

:)
